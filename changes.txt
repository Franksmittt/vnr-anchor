Changes

It would be great if we could move forward with the website – we are quite eager to get it up and running.

The attached needs to be integrated with our webpage – Clients and interested parties must know that they should invest through us, at Anchor: it is important that investment enquiries are made on the VNR/Anchor landing page (See PDF contact us) https://landing.anchorcapital.co.za/vnr-wealth-division or by calling us. Make it clear that we assist them with "tax efficient structuring" and other tax saving investment tools like Tax Free investments and Retirement Annuities.

Furthermore, it is also important that clients/visitors are aware that we have a dedicated independent financial advisor (this is not related to the Anchor Capital matters) – He can see you at our offices if convenient or visit you. He provides advice on life cover, including dread disease and disability cover, we look with him at succession planning, including Buy and Sell agreements, Keyman policies and share buy back plans. (He also links up with our estate planning in this regard), he can also look at your short-term insurance needs.

It is also important that clients are asked if their wills are up to date and that they contact us for assistance. Here we also have specialist partners we work with regarding planning and winding up of estates (I don't want to mention the partner's name here) – We draft Wills for free if VNR or our partner is appointed as executor.

It is also important that the Facebook ads we are running "tie in" with the website – the ad is as follows:


This isn't just about filing your return. It's about not losing money that never needed to be lost. If you're a South African expat or contractor, your tax game is different.

Anchor Capital stands as a prominent player in South Africa's financial landscape, embodying an entrepreneurial spirit that has propelled it from a boutique startup to a global asset management powerhouse. Established in 2009 by Peter Armitage, a seasoned investment analyst with a background at major firms like Merrill Lynch and Deutsche Bank, the company quickly positioned itself as a client-centric alternative to traditional banking giants. Armitage, who began his career in global markets in 1994 and earned accolades as a top-rated analyst, founded Anchor with a vision to deliver superior returns through a world-class investment process while fostering authentic relationships. This foundation has evolved into a firm that now employs over 400 professionals across multiple continents, managing R230 billion in assets under management (AUM) following its strategic merger with UK-based Credo in November 2023.

The company's history reflects resilience and strategic growth. Initially part of Anchor Group, which was founded in 2012 and listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) in 2014, Anchor Capital navigated early challenges including high-net-worth client inflows and acquisitions to expand distribution. Key milestones include delisting from the JSE in 2021 to focus on private operations, and the Credo merger, which enhanced its international reach and shifted two-thirds of assets to global markets. Despite setbacks like write-downs on investments such as Capricorn GEMS and Astoria (totaling R10 billion in losses), the firm achieved 26% AUM growth to R72.5 billion by 2020, with net inflows exceeding R6 billion. Today, Anchor operates with a strong balance sheet, low capital intensity, and a BEE rating targeting level 1 or 2, underscoring its commitment to inclusivity and sustainability in South Africa.

#### Business Model and Operations
Anchor's business model is built on a dual focus: wealth management for individuals and asset management for institutions and advisors. Revenue primarily stems from management fees (targeting a 75bps blended yield), advice fees, and brokerage, with an emphasis on organic growth, partnerships, and acquisitions. The firm organizes around client needs, offering local and offshore solutions to navigate exponential change. Its global footprint—spanning Sandton (headquarters), Centurion, Cape Town, Durban, Pretoria, Mauritius, London, and Florida—supports seamless international investments, positioning clients as "global investment citizens". Technology plays a pivotal role, with partnerships like LanDynamix providing co-managed IT services, a Security Operations Centre (SOC), and anomaly detection to safeguard sensitive data and ensure compliance. This infrastructure not only enhances operational efficiency but also boosts client trust, as evidenced by improved productivity and Wi-Fi upgrades that staff describe as "life-changing."

Anchor's values—trust, high performance, diversity, and exceeding expectations—guide its operations. The firm hires based on character, caliber, and chemistry, resulting in a team rich in qualifications: over 30 investment professionals, 17 chartered accountants, and 23 CFA charter-holders. Strategic goals include reaching R150 billion AUM in four years, R1 billion turnover, and expanding UK presence, with annual net new assets targeted at R7-15 billion.

#### Services, Features, and Benefits
Anchor's services are segmented into wealth and asset management, catering to a diverse clientele from high-net-worth families to pension funds.

- **Wealth Management (Private Clients):** Tailored for individuals, this includes bespoke portfolios, retirement planning, estate structuring, and tax optimization. Advisors like Brendan Gace (Head of Private Clients) emphasize long-term relationships, with features such as offshore access and risk management tools. Benefits include wealth preservation and growth, with clients gaining from personalized advice that adapts to life stages—e.g., emigration support for UK-based expats.

- **Asset Management:** Targeted at institutions and advisors, this encompasses unit trusts, hedge funds, multi-managed solutions, and segregated mandates. Products like the Anchor BCI Global Technology Fund aim for long-term returns through active management, while hedge funds diversify risks across South African assets. Features include building-block approaches for pension funds, blending active and passive strategies for real diversification without sacrificing returns. Benefits are evident in enhanced portfolio resilience and access to global markets, helping clients achieve competitive relevance in volatile environments.

Unique offerings include educational resources like "The Navigator" webinars, covering asset allocation and market ideas (e.g., Ferrari, Tesla), and newsletters providing daily insights. These tools empower clients with knowledge, reducing reliance on advisors while fostering informed decisions.

| Service Category | Key Features | Primary Benefits | Target Clients |
|------------------|--------------|------------------|----------------|
| Wealth Management | Bespoke portfolios, offshore investments, estate planning | Personalized growth, risk mitigation, tax efficiency | High-net-worth individuals, families, retirees |
| Asset Management | Unit trusts, hedge funds, segregated mandates | Diversified returns, customization, institutional-scale solutions | Financial advisors, institutions, pension funds |
| Research & Education | Newsletters, webinars, market commentary | Informed decision-making, proactive insights | All clients, including retail investors |
| Technology-Enabled Services | SOC for security, anomaly detection, Wi-Fi enhancements | Data protection, operational efficiency, compliance | Global clients handling sensitive financial data |

#### Performance and Investment Approach
Anchor's investment philosophy prioritizes top-quartile returns in 75% of products, with a focus on innovation and risk management. Recent performance highlights include the Anchor BCI Worldwide Flexible Fund's 25.7% return over 12 months (to June 2025) and 12.6% annualized since inception. The Anchor BCI SA Equity Fund rose 6.1% in September 2025, outperforming amid market concentration. Hedge funds like the Anchor Multi Strategy FR QI aim for growth in all conditions, with annual fees at 1.25% plus performance-based incentives.

Forecasts remain cautiously optimistic: double-digit SA equity returns (10%) and listed property (11%) over the next year, despite 35% gains in 2025. However, returns can fluctuate—e.g., Anchor BCI Equity B saw a -1.83% one-day dip, with a 0.90% expense ratio. The firm warns against tactical shifts in volatile markets, advocating long-term allocations.

| Selected Funds | 12-Month Return (as of latest data) | Annualized Return (since inception) | Expense Ratio | Focus |
|----------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------|-------|
| Anchor BCI Worldwide Flexible | 25.7% (to Jun 2025) | 12.6% | N/A | Global equities, flexible allocation |
| Anchor BCI SA Equity | 6.1% (Sep 2025 monthly) | N/A | N/A | South African equities |
| Anchor BCI Global Technology | N/A | Aims for long-term maximization | N/A | Global tech equities |
| Anchor Multi Strategy FR QI Hedge | N/A | Growth in all conditions | 1.25% + perf fee | Multi-strategy hedging |
| Anchor BCI Equity B | -1.83% (recent 1-day) | N/A | 0.90% | Equity-focused |

#### Team and Leadership
Anchor's strength lies in its experienced team, led by Peter Armitage (CEO and Founder), who oversees strategy with a track record of building high-performing units. Other key figures include Omair Khan (CFO, focusing on risk and acquisitions), Neil Brown (Head of Asset Management, with actuarial expertise), and Nolan Wapenaar (Fixed Income specialist). The team boasts diverse backgrounds, from law and anthropology to economics, ensuring holistic advice.

| Role | Key Members | Qualifications/Experience |
|------|-------------|---------------------------|
| Executive Leadership | Peter Armitage (CEO), Omair Khan (CFO) | CA (SA), top analyst ratings; Financial reporting, risk management |
| Wealth Management | Brendan Gace (Head), Deon Katz, Harold Hopking | CFP, MBA; 20+ years in private banking and planning |
| Asset Management | Neil Brown (Head), Nolan Wapenaar, Henry Biddlecombe | BSC, CFA; Actuarial, fixed-income expertise |
| Investment & Analysis | David Gibb, James Bennett, FJ Veldman | CFA, CA (SA); Global equities, portfolio management |

#### Reputation, Tone of Voice, and Challenges
Reputation is generally positive, with employee reviews highlighting a great culture, flexibility, and growth opportunities, though some cite long hours and average pay. Client feedback is sparse on public platforms like Trustpilot or HelloPeter, but internal surveys post-technology upgrades note enhanced trust and efficiency. Anchor has faced challenges, including a 2015 link to the Belvedere scandal (no breaches found) and 2023 impersonation fraud alerts, but these appear isolated without lasting impact.

The tone of voice is professional, insightful, and motivational—evident in social media posts that blend economic analysis with calls to "stay ahead" using hashtags like #AnchorInsights and #InvestWisely. Communications acknowledge uncertainties (e.g., consumer caution amid resilience) while promoting action, maintaining an approachable, empathetic stance that aligns with its client-first ethos.

In summary, Anchor Capital's blend of innovation, expertise, and adaptability positions it well for future growth, though investors should consider market risks and personal fit when engaging its services.

10 Costly Tax Mistakes

Expats & Independent

Contractors Make
and How To
Avoid Them
and How To
Avoid Them

Presented By:
VNR (Pty) Ltd

ASSUMING YOU’RE NO LONGER TAXABLE IN
SOUTH AFRICA JUST BECAUSE YOU LIVE ABROAD

What is it? You believe that because you’re physically
working overseas or living abroad, you’ve automatically
escaped your tax obligations in South Africa.

Why it applies: Under South Africa’s tax system, if
you are a tax resident you remain liable for tax on
worldwide income. Even if you live abroad, you may
still be classified as resident for tax purposes if you do
not meet the “cease-residence” tests.

Example scenario: Mark is a South African citizen
who has taken a 2-year contract in Dubai. He retains his
Johannesburg house, visits family regularly in SA, and
has not formally notified South African Revenue Service
(SARS) of any change of status. He believes “I live
abroad, so I’m done with SA tax.” In reality, SARS may
still class him as resident and expect him to declare his
Dubai income.

What’s at risk: Mark could find he has undeclared
foreign income liable to SA tax, surprise tax bills, plus
penalties for non-filing or late filing. He may also lose
out on exemptions or credits.

Possible Penalties: Administrative penalties for failure
to submit returns can range from R250 to R16 000 per
month, for each month your return remains outstanding
(up to 35 months). Also, if your taxable income was
under-declared you could face understatement
penalties (5%-200%).

Action step (to avoid it): Review your tax-residency
status with a tax advisor: evaluate where your “ordinary
residence” is, how many days you spent in SA, where
your home/life is. If you should no longer be resident,
follow the formal process to cease residency. If you are
still resident, identify your foreign income and ensure
it’s properly declared or exempted

FAILING TO CEASE RESIDENCY CORRECTLY /
IGNORING RESIDENCY TESTS

What is it? You assume you’ve left South Africa’s tax
net because you’ve moved abroad, but you haven’t
satisfied the legal tests (ordinary residence or physical
presence) and haven’t taken the formal steps.

Why it applies: SARS uses an “ordinary residence” test
and a “physical presence” test to determine whether
you are resident for tax. If you fail either, you may still
be resident and liable for tax on worldwide income.

Example scenario: Sarah relocates to London for 18
months to work on a project. She keeps her SA bank
account, visits SA every few months, and leaves her car
registered in Pretoria. She thinks “I’m gone, so I don’t
need to worry about SA tax.” In fact, since she hasn
't

broken enough ties and still meets the presence/things-
in-SA test, SARS could regard her as still resident.

What’s at risk: Sarah might still owe tax on
income she earned abroad; she might also lose
access to certain exemptions; and the clock may
start on penalties from the date she should have
filed.

Possible Penalties: As above, failure to file

returns leads to monthly admin penalties; under-
declared amounts may lead to large penalties

(up to 200% of the shortfall) plus interest.

Action step (to avoid it): Document your move
abroad: track when you left, how many days you
were in SA, your ties (home, bank, family). Speak
with your tax advisor to determine whether you
have become a non-resident for tax. If yes,
ensure you apply the correct forms, submit final
resident return, and notify SARS. If no, treat
yourself as resident and plan accordingly.

What is it? You assume that because you work abroad you
automatically qualify for the “foreign employment income
exemption” and that your foreign salary is fully exempt from SA
tax, but the rules are strict and often don’t apply to contractors.

Why it applies: The exemption only applies to remuneration
(i.e., employee relationship) for services rendered outside
South Africa, and there are day-tests (e.g., 183 full days abroad
in the 12-month period) plus other criteria. Crucially,
independent contractors are excluded (their income is not
considered “remuneration”).

Example scenario: David is a South African tax resident and
did freelance consulting for a Canadian firm from Indonesia. He
sees the exemption and thinks “my income is from abroad, so it’s
free of SA tax”. Later he finds out: as a contractor (not an
employee) and because his services were partly rendered while
in SA, the exemption doesn’t apply.
MIS-USING THE FOREIGN
EMPLOYMENT INCOME EXEMPTION

What’s at risk: David may actually owe SA tax on
his full contract income; he may have incorrectly
claimed exemption; he may have missed planning
for tax; he may even have to amend filed returns.

Possible Penalties: If a taxpayer wrongly claims
the exemption, SARS can assess for the full tax

payable plus interest. Under-estimation or mis-
statement penalties (again: up to 200% of shortfall)

may apply.

Action step (to avoid it): Check whether you
qualify: Are you an employee (not contractor)? Did
you render services outside SA for at least 183 full
days in a 12-month period? Is the 60 full-days test
satisfied? If you don’t qualify, plan for your overseas
income to be taxable in SA. Use a tax advisor to
structure things properly, track days abroad, record
where services were rendered.

MIS-CLASSIFYING YOURSELF
(CONTRACTOR VS EMPLOYEE)
What is it? You treat yourself as an independent contractor
(or your client treats you as one) but in fact, under the tax
law tests you meet the criteria of an employee, with all the
withheld PAYE, UIF, and tax implications.

Why it applies: The difference matters because for
employees, tax is withheld via PAYE and certain
benefits/obligations apply; for contractors you manage your
own tax and claim business expenses.

Example scenario: Karen provides design services for one
long-term client. The client dictates the hours she works,
provides her with equipment, and she works on-site at their
premises — though contract calls her an “independent
consultant”. In fact, she looks like an employee. SARS may
re-classify the arrangement: client owes PAYE on amounts
paid to her; Karen loses contractor-deduction rights.

What’s at risk: You might face back-tax liabilities,
you might have to repay PAYE plus interest and
penalties. You might lose the benefit of business
deductions you claimed as a contractor.

Possible Penalties: Employers that fail to deduct
or pay PAYE can face penalties up to 10% plus
understatement penalties (0-200%) and interest. For
the individual, direct consequences include higher
tax bills, increased scrutiny, reduced deductions.

Action step (to avoid it): Review your working
relationship with each client: check control,
substitution, risk/profit-loss, number of clients. If
you are subject to control, you lean toward
employee status. Engage your tax advisor or
employment-law specialist to assess your status,
and adjust contract or tax treatment accordingly.

What is it? You earn income that is not subject to PAYE
(for example from freelance, contracting, foreign
income) but fail to register as a provisional taxpayer and
miss making the required advance payments (IRP6) to
SARS.

Why it applies: Independent contractors and
freelancers often fall into the provisional tax regime
because they don’t have amounts withheld by an
employer. Missing this means you have to pay large
lump sums, risk penalties and interest.

Example scenario: Sipho runs a solo copy-writing
business and earns R1.4 million over the year. He doesn’t
register as a provisional taxpayer, thinking “I’ll deal with
tax when I file my annual return”. When his return is
assessed, he’s hit with a substantial tax liability plus
penalties for under-estimating and for late payment.

What’s at risk: Cash-flow shock, large tax bills, penalties
and interest accumulating, stress of filing. Your business may
need to divert funds that you’d planned to reinvest.

Possible Penalties: If a provisional taxpayer fails to make
payments on time, SARS imposes a late-payment penalty of
10% of the tax amount not paid, plus interest at the
prescribed rate (often around 10% per annum) until it’s paid.
Also, if you underestimate your taxable income you can incur

additional penalties (20% in some cases) for under-
estimating.

Action step (to avoid it): Check if you need to register for
provisional tax (if you earn non-PAYE income). Register via
SARS eFiling. Estimate your taxable income early in the year,
set aside enough money. Make the first payment by 6 months
after the year start (often 31 August) and second payment by
year-end (often 28 Feb) or as required. If unsure how much,
talk to your tax advisor now and put aside monthly reserves.

MISSING PROVISIONAL TAX
OBLIGATIONS

FAILING TO CLAIM ALLOWABLE
DEDUCTIONS/EXPENSES
What is it? As a contractor (or expat with business
income) you either don’t claim legitimate business
expenses (thereby overpaying tax), or you claim
expenses you’re not actually entitled to (which can
trigger audits/penalties).

Why it applies: Contractors often assume “because I’m
a business, all my costs are deductible”

, but there are
specific rules: personal vs business use, home-office
rules, travel logbooks, documentation etc. Without
proper substantiation you risk disallowed deductions.

Example scenario: James is a South African-based
digital marketing consultant earning R4 million a year.
He works from his home office, has trips abroad, pays for
his smartphone, subscriptions, business lunches, includes
them all as “deductible”. He hasn’t kept detailed
receipts or separated personal vs business use. When
audited, SARS disallows many of his claimed expenses.

What’s at risk: James either ends up paying more tax than
necessary (if he fails to claim valid deductions) or faces
additional tax plus interest/penalties (if his claims are
disallowed). His cash-flow suffers, and his compliance
record is damaged.

Possible Penalties: If SARS finds an understatement due
to incorrect deduction claims, you may face an
understatement penalty of up to 200% of the tax shortfall,
plus interest from the date of understatement. Also, you
may lose future deduction rights until your records improve.

Action step (to avoid it): Maintain separate business vs
personal expenses, keep full records (invoices, receipts,
logbooks). When using home office/travel/mobile phone,
document the business portion. Before filing, have a tax
specialist review your deduction list, ensure each item
meets the criteria (is “in the production of income”), and
prepare for a possible audit.

What is it? You earn income overseas (or from a foreign
source) and either pay tax twice (once abroad and again in
South Africa) or you assume relief is automatic and miss
claiming it.

Why it applies: South Africa uses a residence-based tax
system for residents (worldwide income). If you also pay
tax abroad, you may qualify for foreign tax credits or relief
under treaty provisions (for example via section 6quat). If
you don’t apply correctly, you pay unnecessarily.

Example scenario: Pieter is living in Australia for 2 years
and earns income there. He pays Australian tax. He remains
a South African tax resident (he hasn’t ceased residency).
He files in SA but doesn’t claim foreign tax credit. As a
result, he pays South African tax on his foreign income and
doesn’t get full relief for what he already paid in Australia.
DOUBLE-TAXATION OR MISSING RELIEF
UNDER DOUBLE TAX AGREEMENTS (DTAS)

What’s at risk: He ends up paying more tax than
required. His net return on international work is
lower. He may also miss strategic planning

opportunities such as using a DTA to reduce tax or re-
classify income.

Possible Penalties: While the primary issue is over-
taxation rather than penalty, if you misstate or omit

income (assuming relief automatically applies) and
later adjust, you could face interest/penalties. Also
you lose the financial benefit of the correct
treatment.

Action step (to avoid it): Identify all your foreign
income, note the foreign tax paid. Check whether a
DTA applies between South Africa and the foreign
country. On your SA return, claim a foreign tax credit
(section 6quat) or other relief. Consult a cross-border
tax advisor to confirm relief eligibility and ensure
your return and credit claim are correctly lodged.

What is it? Because of the nature of your contracting, remote
working, foreign employer/client relationships, you inadvertently
trigger additional tax or employer obligations either in South
Africa or abroad, beyond just your personal income tax.

Why it applies: With more contractors and expats working
remotely for foreign clients, there’s risk you could create a
taxable presence for the foreign client, or you might be treated
as an employee rather than contractor. Also you could owe
employer‐type taxes.

Example scenario: Kevin is a South African contractor working
online for a UK company while living in SA. He uses their systems,
follows their timetable, and the company provides most tools
and guidance. SARS deems he’s effectively an employee from a
compliance viewpoint. Meanwhile the UK company may face UK
obligations as his “employer”. Kevin thus has unclear status and
risks both SA tax + foreign employer compliance issues.
TRIGGERING A “PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT”
OR FOREIGN EMPLOYER COMPLIANCE TRAP

What’s at risk: Unexpected tax bills (employer tax,
UIF, PAYE) either for you or the client company, risk
of re-classification, and your business structure may
not have been set up correctly for tax.

Possible Penalties: For mis-classified employer:
back PAYE, interest, employer penalties. For you: you
may lose contractor tax benefits, face audit, and have
additional tax liability. Also your client may terminate
contract or restructure it, affecting your income.

Action step (to avoid it): Review your contract and
work relationship with foreign clients: Are you truly

independent (control your hours, tools, risk/profit-
loss)? Or are you subordinate? Clarify terms, possibly

restructure as a B-BBEE compliant contractor, ensure
your status is clear. Use a tax/legal advisor to review
and ensure your cross-border contracting model is
clean and documented.

LATE FILING / NON-COMPLIANCE / BEING
FLAGGED BY SARS’S INCREASED DATA ANALYTICS

What is it? You delay filing your returns, don’t comply with
deadlines (for either resident tax, provisional tax, or expat
returns), or fail to properly disclose income/payments,
which increases your risk of being audited or penalised by
the South African Revenue Service.

Why it applies: Contractors and expats often have more
complex affairs (foreign income, multiple clients, travel)
and may put off filing until “I’ll sort it later”. SARS uses data

analytics to pick up mismatches (foreign income, non-
residents, contractors) and non-filers.

Example scenario: Raymond is an expat working in
Singapore but still deemed a SA resident. He skips filing a
return for the year because he assumes overseas income
covers him. SARS’ data flags foreign payment transactions
which don’t match his SA filing. They open a query when he
returns to SA and he learns his return is late and incomplete.

What’s at risk: You face late-filing penalties, interest,
potential audit, distraction and cost. You might also
suffer reputational damage, lose time in managing the
issue rather than growing your business or living abroad.

Possible Penalties: Late filing of returns may incur
fixed administrative penalties (R250 to R16,000 per
month). Under-statement penalties if income not
declared (0-200% depending on culpability). Interest
on outstanding tax. Projects or transfers abroad may be
delayed if your tax record is flagged.

Action step (to avoid it): Mark all relevant deadlines in
your calendar (annual return, provisional payments,
non-resident returns). If you’re an expat, confirm your
filing obligations. Set up a simple system (or outsource)
so you compile your income/expense information each
quarter. Engage your tax advisor early — don’t wait
until the rush. Respond promptly to any SARS notices.
